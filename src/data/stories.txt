Title: The Missing Piece

The door hung open like a wound against the night.

Tamara pressed herself against the oak's rough bark, her breath forming silver clouds in the mountain air. Bastian's cabin sat before her in the clearing, windows dark as dead eyes, and that door—that door that should have been barred and locked—swaying in the wind like a taunt.

*He never leaves it open. Never.*

The scent of pine needles and wood smoke should have been comforting here, twenty miles from the nearest village, forty from the capital where her sister's crown caught torchlight and cast shadows that stretched across kingdoms. But tonight the familiar smells carried something else: the metallic tang of spilled copper, the acrid bite of burnt parchment.

Her fingers found the hilt of the blade at her hip, muscle memory from years of running, years of looking over her shoulder at every hoofbeat, every crow's cry that might herald the queen's hunters. The leather grip was worn smooth from her touch, a talisman against the darkness that had swallowed her life whole the day she learned her true name.

*Bastian has answers. He always has answers.*

She moved like smoke between the trees, feet finding the silent spaces between fallen branches. The clearing opened before her, and she could see now what she'd hoped she wouldn't: the overturned table, papers scattered like snow across the wooden floor, the chair that lay on its side with one leg snapped clean through.

The hearth was cold. Bastian's hearth was never cold.

"Bastian?" Her voice was barely a whisper, but it seemed to echo in the stillness. No answer came save the wind through the pines, mourning something she couldn't name.

Inside, chaos. Books torn from their shelves, their spines broken, pages bleeding ink onto the floorboards. The map of the realm—the one marked with routes and safe houses, with X's over places where a fugitive princess might find sanctuary—hung in tatters above the mantle. Someone had taken a blade to it, carved deep gouges through every marked location.

*They know. They know everything.*

Her knees nearly buckled. How long had she been living on borrowed time? How many nights had she slept in barns and caves, believing herself safe, while her sister's spies noted every movement, every ally, every breath she drew in defiance of the crown?

A piece of parchment caught her attention, partially hidden beneath the debris. Her hands shook as she lifted it, recognizing Bastian's careful script despite the blood that had dried in dark spots across the surface.

*The bloodline runs deeper than she knows. The treaty signed in her father's hand binds more than kingdoms—it binds souls. Find the Keeper of the Eastern March. Trust no one else. The missing piece isn't what she thinks it is.*

The missing piece. Tamara's throat constricted. That's what she'd always been called in the whispered conversations she wasn't supposed to hear, in the letters intercepted by loyalists, in the proclamations that demanded her return to face the crown's justice. A missing piece of some grand design she'd never understood.

She'd thought it meant her claim to succession, her inconvenient existence as the late king's acknowledged bastard. She'd thought it meant the supporters who would flock to her banner if she chose to press her birthright. She'd thought it meant the civil war that would tear the realm apart if two sisters fought for one throne.

But Bastian's words suggested something else entirely. Something that made her skin crawl with possibilities she couldn't yet name.

A branch snapped in the forest beyond the clearing.

Tamara's head snapped up, every instinct screaming danger. The sound hadn't been random—too heavy for a deer, too deliberate for the wind. She stuffed the parchment into her coat and drew her blade in one fluid motion, the steel singing as it cleared the sheath.

Another sound. Closer now. The soft jingle of mail, the whisper of leather against steel.

*The queen's hunters.*

Through the broken window, she glimpsed movement in the treeline. A flash of silver, the deep blue of the royal guard's cloaks. They moved with purpose, not searching but approaching. They knew exactly where to find her.

The betrayal cut deeper than any blade. Someone had told them she would come here. Someone who knew her well enough to predict that when the world collapsed around her, she would run to Bastian's cabin seeking answers and finding only emptiness.

She thought of her sister, beautiful and terrible in her crown of twisted gold, and wondered if she'd ever truly known the woman who shared her father's eyes. They'd played together as children before duty and destiny had carved them into enemies. Before the crown had made one a queen and the other a threat.

But there was no time for old grief now. The Eastern March lay three days' hard ride through territory crawling with her sister's soldiers. The Keeper—whoever that was—held answers Bastian had died protecting. And somewhere in the space between heartbeats, as the sound of approaching footsteps grew closer, Tamara made the choice that would define everything that came after.

She would not run again.

The back window opened without a sound—Bastian had kept the hinges well-oiled for exactly this purpose. But instead of fleeing into the forest as they expected, she melted into the shadows beside the door and waited.

When the first hunter stepped across the threshold, she was ready.

The game had changed. The missing piece would no longer hide.
