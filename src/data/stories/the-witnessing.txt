Title: The Witnessing

The morning mist clung to Maren's skin like guilt as she approached the compound's wooden gates. No guards—just a child of perhaps eight, barefoot and wide-eyed, who gestured for her to follow. The forest pressed close on all sides, ancient cedars forming a cathedral of shadow that swallowed sound and light with equal hunger.

"The Illuminated One will see you now," the child whispered, voice barely audible above the rustle of leaves. "He's been waiting."

Maren's heart stuttered. Three weeks of preparation, months of building her cover identity as a lost soul seeking purpose, and none of it had prepared her for those words. *He's been waiting.* As if her arrival was prophecy rather than careful intelligence work.

The compound opened before her like a mouth. Wooden structures seemed to grow from the earth itself, their walls curved and organic, defying right angles. Solar panels glinted dully through gaps in the canopy—the only concession to the modern world. Everything else belonged to some earlier time, when faith moved through forests and prophets spoke in clearings.

She counted exits, noted the placement of buildings, catalogued faces—all while maintaining the expression of someone seeking salvation. The training never left her, even here in this place that felt removed from the world's logic.

"Sister." The voice came from behind her, warm and familiar as childhood. She turned slowly, every muscle taut with disbelief.

Ellis stood in the doorway of what might have been a chapel, or perhaps just another gathering place in this community that blurred all boundaries. His hair had grown long, silver-streaked now though he was only thirty-four—her age exactly, to the minute. The bones of his face remained sharp, beautiful in the way that had always made strangers stare. But his eyes held something new, something that made her skin crawl with recognition and revulsion.

Certainty. The kind that could move mountains or burn cities.

"You look tired," he said, stepping closer. "The journey here is long for all of us."

She wanted to scream his name, to demand explanations, to shake him until the brother she'd mourned fell back into his bones. Instead, she inclined her head with the deference she'd practiced.

"I've been searching," she managed. "For truth. For purpose. Someone told me I might find both here."

Ellis smiled, and for a moment she saw the boy who'd shared her room, who'd whispered stories in the dark when their parents fought. Then the expression shifted, became something polished and distant.

"Truth finds us when we're ready to receive it," he said. "What name do you carry in this place?"

She'd prepared for this. "Maya."

"Maya." He tasted the word like wine. "The veil of illusion. How perfect. Come, let me show you what lies beneath."

He led her through the compound, past gardens where people worked in silence, their movements synchronized like dancers. Children played games that looked like rituals, their laughter crystalline in the filtered light. Everything was beautiful, pastoral, wrong.

"We call it the Sanctuary," Ellis said, his hand briefly touching her shoulder. The contact sent electricity through her—recognition, fear, something darker. "A place where the old world's poisons can be cleansed from our spirits."

"And you're their leader?"

"Leader?" He laughed, and she remembered that sound from a thousand shared moments. "I'm merely a voice. Truth speaks through me, not because I'm special, but because I've learned to listen."

They stopped beside a fire pit where twenty people sat in a circle, eyes closed, swaying slightly. The air shimmered with heat and something else—expectation, devotion, madness given form.

"Tonight you'll join the Witnessing," Ellis said. "It's how we come to know each other here. No secrets, no lies. Only truth in its rawest form."

Maren's throat tightened. "What does that mean?"

"We share what we were before we became who we are. The Witnessing sees through all masks." His eyes found hers, and for a heartbeat she was certain he knew. Knew who she was, why she'd come, what she represented. "It can be... intense. But necessary."

A woman approached, moving with the fluid grace of someone whose every gesture had been refined by ritual. Her smile was warm, maternal, terrifying in its completeness.

"This is Sister Dove," Ellis said. "She'll help you prepare."

"Blessed be your arrival," Dove said, taking Maren's hands. Her fingers were surprisingly strong, calloused from labor. "We've prepared a space for you. Time to shed the old skin."

They led her to a small cabin that smelled of cedar and sage. Inside, simple furniture, handwoven blankets, no mirrors. A white dress hung from a wooden peg—rough cotton, shapeless, designed to erase rather than flatter.

"The Witnessing begins at sunset," Dove explained. "Wear nothing but this. Bring nothing but truth."

Alone, Maren pressed her back against the door and tried to steady her breathing. Ellis was alive. Ellis was here, commanding followers with the same charisma that had made teachers favor him, made friends orbit around him like planets around a star. But this was different. This was worship.

Through the small window, she watched him move through the compound, people touching his shoulder, his hand, seeking blessing through contact. He accepted it all with serene detachment, as if he truly believed himself to be something more than human.

The sun began its descent, painting the forest in shades of amber and blood. Soon she would sit in that circle, surrounded by believers, with Ellis watching as she constructed lies about her past. The Witnessing would demand truth, and she would give them fiction wrapped in sincerity.

But what truth was Ellis telling them? What story had he built around the boy who'd disappeared from their shared life, leaving only questions and a hollow ache where certainty used to live?

She pulled on the white dress, feeling it transform her into someone else—someone seeking, someone lost, someone who might be saved. In the distance, drums began to beat, calling the faithful to witness and be witnessed.

Maren walked toward the sound, toward the fire, toward her brother who was no longer her brother but something else entirely. The forest closed behind her, and ahead lay truths she wasn't sure she was ready to hear.

The drums grew louder, and she felt herself being pulled forward by their rhythm, by the promise of revelation, by the terrible hunger to understand what Ellis had become in the ten years since he'd walked out of their shared world and into this one.

Tonight, she would witness. And perhaps, finally, she would understand what it meant to lose yourself so completely that even your own twin could become a stranger.
