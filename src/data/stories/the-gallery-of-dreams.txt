Title: The Gallery of Dreams

The house breathed differently at night.

Ava pressed her palm against the cool plaster wall, feeling the subtle pulse beneath her fingertips—a rhythm that didn't match her own heartbeat. She'd been living here three weeks now, long enough to know that the Victorian's quirks weren't just settling wood or old pipes. The rooms shifted when she wasn't looking, rearranging themselves like puzzle pieces seeking their proper place.

Tonight, her studio had grown longer. The north wall, where she'd hung her latest canvas—a violent slash of cerulean and burnt umber that screamed *forget, forget, forget*—now stretched impossibly into shadow. Paint tubes scattered across her makeshift table caught moonlight like fallen stars, and the air tasted of turpentine and something else. Something sweet and sad, like cherry blossoms wilting in rain.

"You're afraid of your own memories."

The voice came from everywhere and nowhere, a whisper that might have been wind through the gaps in the window frame. Ava's brush froze mid-stroke, indigo bleeding down the canvas like tears.

"I know you hear me." Softer now, tinged with desperate hope. "You've been painting around me for weeks."

Ava set down her brush with trembling fingers. In the corner of her vision, something shimmered—not quite light, not quite shadow. She'd glimpsed it before: a figure at the edge of rooms, a reflection that didn't match reality, footsteps on stairs she couldn't see.

"What do you want?" The words scraped her throat raw.

The shimmer solidified, and suddenly the studio wasn't a studio anymore.


The gallery materialized around them like a held breath released. Walls stretched toward a star-scattered ceiling that pulsed with aurora light, and floating frames displayed paintings Ava had never created but somehow recognized. Here was her mother's laugh, captured in brushstrokes of gold and amber. There, her father's hands teaching her to hold a pencil, rendered in careful charcoal. Memories she'd been trying to bury glowed with impossible beauty.

In the center stood a girl who couldn't have been older than sixteen. Her hair fell in dark waves over a school uniform from another decade, and her eyes held the particular brightness of those who had died too young.

"I'm Yuki," she said, as if they were meeting at a café instead of in a dreamscape gallery. "This is my house. Well, it was my family's house. Before."

Ava's chest tightened. "Before what?"

"Before the accident. Before they moved away and couldn't bear to sell it. Before forty years of emptiness." Yuki drifted closer, her form solidifying with each step. "Before you came here to disappear."

"I'm not disappearing." But even as Ava said it, she knew it was a lie. She'd chosen this house precisely because it felt forgotten, abandoned, a place where she could finally stop being the daughter who survived, the artist who lived while her parents died, the woman who carried their dreams like stones in her chest.

Yuki gestured to the floating paintings. "You're trying to forget them. But look—your grief makes beautiful things."

"My grief makes me want to die." The confession tore from Ava's throat before she could stop it.

"But you don't. You paint instead." Yuki's smile was gentle, understanding in the way only the dead could be. "That's the difference between us. I forgot how to want anything except to be remembered. You forgot how to want anything except to forget."

The gallery shifted, walls breathing in and out like lungs. New paintings appeared—some of Ava's actual work, others that seemed pulled from Yuki's memories. A school dance where she'd worn her mother's lipstick. Study sessions with friends who'd grown old without her. Cherry blossoms in the backyard garden that had long since died.

"Why show me this?" Ava whispered.

"Because you see me." Yuki's form flickered, fear creeping into her voice. "No one has seen me in decades. Not really. I thought I wanted to be remembered, but what I really wanted was to be *seen*. The way you see pain and turn it into art. The way you look at empty rooms and fill them with meaning."

Ava reached toward one of Yuki's memory-paintings—a family dinner where everyone laughed at once—and her fingers passed through the frame like water. "I can't bring them back. Your family, my parents. None of them."

"I'm not asking you to." Yuki stepped closer, close enough that Ava could feel the chill of her presence. "I'm asking you to remember that forgetting isn't the opposite of grief. Creating is."

The gallery began to dissolve at the edges, reality bleeding back in like watercolors in rain. But before it vanished completely, Yuki caught Ava's hand. For just a moment, her touch felt solid, warm, alive.

"Paint me," she whispered. "Not to bring me back, but to prove I was here. And maybe... maybe paint yourself too. The version that survived. The version that makes beautiful things from terrible loss."


When Ava woke, she was slumped over her easel, neck stiff from sleeping at an impossible angle. Dawn light filtered through the studio window, turning her scattered paints into prisms. The canvas before her had changed in the night—her violent blues and browns now swirled with delicate cherry blossoms, and in the lower corner, barely visible unless you knew how to look, was the faint outline of a girl in a school uniform.

The house felt different. Quieter, but not empty. Settled, like a long-held breath finally released.

Ava picked up her brush and began to paint—not to forget, not to remember, but to witness. To see and be seen. To turn the weight of carrying the dead into the lightness of carrying their stories forward.

In the mirror across the room, two figures worked side by side: a living woman painting her ghosts, and a ghost learning, finally, how to rest.
