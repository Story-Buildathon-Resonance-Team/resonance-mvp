Title: The Song That Sleeps

The library breathed with the weight of untold words.

Lior pressed his palm against the entrance archway, feeling the marble pulse beneath his touch—each heartbeat a whispered prayer carved by centuries of scholars. The stone was warm, almost alive, and threaded with golden veins where particularly beautiful truths had been spoken aloud. But beneath the beauty lay jagged scars, deep gouges where screams had once torn through the air.

He had not spoken in three days.

"Aela?" His voice cracked like breaking glass, and immediately the sound took shape—crystalline fragments that scattered across the floor, chiming softly as they shattered against fallen books. The echo carved shallow grooves into the nearest pillar before fading.

Silence swallowed his call.

Deeper into the ruins he went, past reading alcoves where silence hung like curtains, so thick it could be touched, so sharp it drew blood from unwary fingers. The absence of sound here had weight and texture—velvet darkness that muffled his footsteps, then suddenly thin as razors where a librarian's final gasp had carved emptiness into the very air.

He found her in the heart of the archive, surrounded by a perfect sphere of crystallized quiet.

Aela sat cross-legged on a cushion of compressed whispers, her fingers dancing across pages that sang beneath her touch. Books floated around her in slow orbits, their covers breathing with stored voices. Her hair, white as unspoken secrets, moved without any wind, stirred by the subtle currents of contained sound.

She had been beautiful once, before she chose blindness. The scars across her eyelids were deliberate, precise—surgical marks she had carved herself to escape a world grown too loud. But her other senses had sharpened to impossible acuity. She could hear the color of starlight, taste the weight of whispered confessions.

"Lior." She spoke his name like a tuning fork, and the sound wrapped around him, warm and knowing. "You carry death in your throat."

He stopped at the edge of her silence-sphere, afraid to break its perfect stillness. "You know why I've come."

"I know the lullaby that lives in you." Her fingertips traced air, reading the invisible harmonics that surrounded him. "It wants to be born. Every breath you take, it grows stronger."

"I've tried everything." The words tumbled out, each syllable carving small wounds in the marble at his feet. "Binding my tongue, sealing my lips with wax. Nothing works. It's getting harder to contain."

Aela tilted her head, listening to frequencies beyond human hearing. Around her, the floating books shivered, their pages rustling with anticipation. "Show me your hands."

Reluctantly, he extended them through her sphere of silence. The quiet pressed against his skin like cold water, making his bones ache. Her fingers found his, tracing the calluses from years of covering his mouth, the small scars from biting his tongue bloody to keep the song contained.

"You've been carrying this alone for so long." Her voice held depths of understanding that made his chest tight. "When did it begin?"

"My sister." The memory carved itself into the air between them, golden and painful. "She couldn't sleep. Nightmares every night after our parents... I wanted to help her. I hummed something, made up a little melody to ease her fears."

Aela's grip tightened on his hands. "And she never woke up."

"She sleeps still. Beautiful dreams, endless and perfect. But she's fading away inside them, becoming less real each day." His voice broke, and the fracture sent spider-web cracks racing across the nearest wall. "The lullaby worked too well. It doesn't just bring sleep—it steals the dreamer away, piece by piece, until nothing remains but the dream itself."

"And you've been afraid to sing it again."

"I've been terrified." The confession hung in the air like a blade. "But it wants out. Every day it grows stronger, and I'm not sure how much longer I can—"

"Sing it to me."

The words hit him like a physical blow. Around them, the library seemed to hold its breath, books falling still in their orbits, whispers fading to expectant hush.

"Aela, no. You don't understand. It will trap you forever."

She smiled, and it was like sunrise breaking over desolation. "I've spent fifteen years in self-imposed silence, child. I've built walls of quiet around my heart to keep the world's noise from destroying me. But in doing so, I've also kept out its music." Her scarred eyes seemed to look directly at him despite their blindness. "I've forgotten what it means to be vulnerable to beauty."

"This isn't beauty. It's destruction wearing a beautiful mask."

"All true art carries destruction within it." She stood, books settling gently to the floor around her. "Creation and devastation are lovers, not enemies. Your lullaby is dangerous precisely because it's perfect—it offers something the human heart cannot resist."

"Then why would you risk it?"

"Because I'm the only one who might understand it well enough to help you reshape it." She stepped forward, her sphere of silence moving with her, enveloping him in its crystalline clarity. "I've learned to live in the spaces between sounds, in the pause between heartbeats. Perhaps I can teach your lullaby to do the same—to leave room for the dreamer to return."

Lior felt tears on his cheeks, each drop striking the floor like a small bell. "What if I lose you too?"

"Then at least I'll go to my sleep having heard something truly beautiful." She reached up and touched his face, fingers gentle as moth wings. "Art requires risk, Lior. The greatest songs are always dangerous."

He closed his eyes, feeling the lullaby stir in his chest like a caged bird sensing dawn. Around them, the library waited, marble and silence and accumulated wisdom holding its breath.

"Sing to me," Aela whispered. "Let me help you transform your curse into a gift."

And in the heart of that ruined archive, where words had weight and silence could cut, Lior opened his mouth and let the lullaby free—trusting, for the first time, that something beautiful might be worth the risk of destruction.

The first note bloomed like a night-flowering vine, wrapping around them both in harmonies older than sorrow.
